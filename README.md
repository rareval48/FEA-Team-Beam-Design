### Reflection
We ended up making changes to the beam so that there was more support on weak points and less support on strong points. As we added more support there was also weight that was added. So we took cut more triangles in places that didnt need support and took of 2 support walls to cut weight. Once we got down to an acceptable weight we then retested the beam.
